<p><i>When it comes to combining spiritual learning, fun and a great location- leave it to Divine Explorer !!<!--more--> What a great place- Bali and organised at one of the best resorts at Nusa Dua Bali. The Bali retreat had all the elements a seeker seeks for inner transformation- learning sessions, guided meditations, holistics exercise, kriya, presence of enlightened masters   and also all the elements a traveller seeks when on a holiday-  sightseeing, fun activities, cultural programs, shopping, bonding with with people from all over the world and great food !! Thank you Divine Explorer for such a beautifully organised learning retreat with enlightened masters.</i><strong><br /></strong></p>
