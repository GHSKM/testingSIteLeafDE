				<h2 class="pageHeader">Why Travel</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<p>People travel, for many reasons...to explore , the see new sights, to discover, to visit, to experience, to relax, to
					rejuvenate, to bond, to reach out…..
					<br> What does a spiritual seeker do….. Goes inwards, questions, seeks the truth, discovers more about less, visits self,
					meditates, bonds with higher consciousness …..
					<br> When we direct our energy and resources towards conscious travel we create experiences that go beyond just travel memories.
					<br> Why not be a conscious traveler ?
					<br> Why not change your journeys to transformational experiences ? </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Grow in wisdom as you travel</li>
					<li>Grow in awareness as you connect with nature and sacred</li>
					<li>Embark on your journey towards the truth...Find your life mission</li>
					<li>Connect with your self , like minded people and sacred energies</li>
